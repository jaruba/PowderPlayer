2.1.22

* Upgrade esprima to 1.2.2

2.1.21

* Fix an issue with defer variables passed to functions getting replaced improperly

2.1.20

* Ensure only one instance of asyncblock loads per process to avoid some weird interactions between multiple separate includes

2.1.19

* Return a 2 arg function for the task callback to work better with libraries that perform arg length sniffing

2.1.18

* Switch to fibers 1.0.1 from 1.0.0

2.1.16

* Replace Uglify parser with Esprima parser

2.1.15

* Adding "ifError" to wrap callbacks that should only be called in the case of an error

2.1.12

* Just a version bump to trigger re-installing fibers for node v0.10.x

2.1.11

* Upgrading to fibers 1.0.0

2.1.10

* Fix a bug with flow.wait() interfering with defer()'d tasks

2.1.9

2.1.6

* Allow the current asyncblock's flow to be gotten from a function called from the current fiber.

2.1.5

2.1.4

* Fix an instance of errors getting swallowed within nested asyncblocks.

2.1.3

* Allow 2nd arg to be specified to an asyncblock, which acts as the return handler.

2.1.1

* Fix issue with asyncblock not working with Coffeescript

2.1.0

* Update to fibers v0.6.8 for node v0.8 support.

2.0.9

* x().sync() optimization - Reuse the fiber from the outer asyncblock in the inner asyncblock. Lower overhead and same behavior.
* Added "end" function to enumerators which should be called if not iterating through the enumerator to prevent a memory leak.

2.0.8

* Update fibers to version 0.6.7 (windows support)
* (Note that something with maintaining line numbers in source transformation looks off on Windows)
* Get rid of use of Fibers global variable per https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers/issues/72

2.0.7

* Update fibers version to 0.6.5

2.0.6

* Integrate JSHint and remove leaked global variables

2.0.5

* Adding firstArgIsError option to allow not treating the first argument passed to the callback as an error

2.0.4

* Correcting an issue with additional newlines getting added when a reference to a defer variable was the last in a block

2.0.3

* Updating uglify-js_scriby to 1.2.5-6 to correct an issue with newlines getting lost after certain expression types

2.0.2

* Source transformation takes 33% less time in benchmark
* Fixed an issue with assigning to or using a deferred variable before it was assigned by the deferred statement

2.0.1

* Fixing an issue with errors not getting thrown when waiting on a specific key

2.0.0

* Source transformation functions asyncFunction.sync, asyncFunction.future, and asyncFunction.defer released
* Deprecated flow.func & asyncblock.wrap in lieu of source transformation being a better solution
* You can now pass the same args to sync, future, & defer as you can to flow.add
* Added benchmark for source transformation
* Updated documentation

1.9.6

* Over 2x performance improvement when walking AST during source transformation

1.9.5

* Improved parser for source transformation and some performance improvement (more to come)

1.9.4

* Beta release of source transformation of asyncFunction.sync, asyncFunction.future, asyncFunction.defer

1.9.3

* Fixing a bug similar to the one fixed for 1.9.1, except when an actual Error is returned instead of a string

1.9.2

* Fix an issue with the first task added without a key not reporting its error correctly

1.9.1

* Fix a bug with an error not getting handled properly if it was returned to a callback within a nested asyncblock before the inner asyncblock waited on an async call

1.9.0

* Refactored code for easier maintenance
* Created benchmark tests to detect performance and memory regressions
* Fixed memory leak introduced in 1.8.0

1.8.0

* Enumerators!

1.7.0

* Adding new flow.sync usage
    * var contents = flow.sync(fs.readFile(path, 'utf8', flow.add()));
* Adding flow.future
    * var future = flow.future(fs.readFile(path, 'utf8', flow.add()));
    * fs.readFile(path, 'utf8', flow.future());

1.6.6

* Adjusting behavior around double callback logic, as sometimes it's necessary when one asyncblock's error handler came from a flow.add()

1.6.5

* Make capturing full stack traces the default behavior (use asyncblock.nostack for old behavior)
* If an exception is thrown directly from the fiber, make sure full stack trace information gets appended to it
* Tie together call stacks from nested asyncblocks (meaning that if asyncblock is used every time before making an async call, full stack traces will always be preserved)
* Improve performance of capturing the initial stack trace

1.6.2

* Fixing an issue with an error not getting reported properly with nested asyncblocks when one asyncblock doesn't set an errorCallback
* Fixing an issue that occured if flow.wait was called within a function called by flow.sync

1.6.1

* Made a change to not reuse fiber on the current stack when creating a new asyncblock by default to allow for better parallelization.

1.6

* Re-organized documentation

1.5.6

* Changing flow.queue to accept function arguments for consistency

1.5.5

* Added flow.set & flow.get
* Allow passing of args in flow.func.future & flow.func.sync

1.5

* flow.func now returns a function that can be invoked at any time to get the result instead of calling .sync()

1.4.5

* flow.wait changed to not wait on futures
* Bugfix: If a task was added with flow.queue, it can be waited on by key with flow.wait
* flow.func chained syntax now supports queueing tasks

1.4

* New syntactic sugar: flow.func chained syntax.

1.3.1

* Bugfix: If an async method on a wrapped object is called after a nested asyncblock, the error handling context would get switched to the nested asyncblock
* When wrapping, don't attempt to guess if the function is async or not. Rely on the caller to not attempt to call non-async style methods.

1.3.0

* Creating an asyncblock when currently running in a fiber reuses the fiber, giving a 30x performance boost when creating nested asyncblocks

1.2.3

* Update fibers dependency to 0.6.4

1.2.2

* Bugfix: If a call to sync or future on a wrapped object calls its callback immediately (before going async), an error occurred.

1.2.1

* Adding caching for asyncblock.wrap calls

1.2.0

* Added asyncblock.wrap, a simple way to get synchronous style access to a module's async functions.

1.1.0

* BREAKING CHANGE - If the callback to an async task passes more than one parameter, only the first will be kept (instead of converting to an array).
  Pass a responseFormat to add to get the other arguments.

1.0.0

* flow.sync added as a shorthand for executing a single task in series
* When ignoring errors, return an Error object if an error occurred during the task
* Fixed a bug with flow.queue when queueing only tasks that finish immediately before calling wait
* Added asyncblock.fullstack to provide more stack trace information (15x slower than plain asyncblock)
* Improved stack traces. You can now see the line where the original error occurred from, even if it originated from an async callback, and some other improvements.

0.9.3

* When throwing a caught error from the fiber, throw it in a nextTick so it has some effect.

0.9.2

* Allow timeouts to not throw errors by passing timeoutIsError: false to add or queue, or set flow.timeoutIsError = false
* Allow object bag syntax for flow.queue as well, to specify parameters key, responseFormat, timeout, timeoutIsError

0.9.1

* Fix bug: When waiting on a task by key that returns a falsey value, the fiber yielded forever

0.9.0

* flow.taskTimeout can be set, which will prevent a task from running for more than the specified number of milliseconds
* If a task's callback is called more than once, an Error will be thrown. This can help point out bugs in user code.
* If a task returned an error that is not of type Error, it is automatically converted. This will help keep call stack information when using system libraries that return strings
* An object bag may be passed to flow.add to specify parameters key, responseFormat, and timeout

0.8.0

* Allow an argument to be passed to flow.wait to wait on a single key

0.7.5

* New functions: addIgnoreError, callbackIgnoreError, queueIgnoreError for cases where you want to explicitly ignore errors

0.7.1

* Performance optimization

0.7.0

* Added support for asynchronously adding tasks via flow.forceWait, flow.queue, and flow.doneAdding

0.6.0

* Added support for throttling active tasks via maxParallel

0.5.0

* Added support for keeping the call stack across async boundary

0.4.0

* Fix memory leak when creating an asyncblock

0.0.7

* Performance improvements

0.0.6

* Adding flow.errorCallback for simplified error handling
